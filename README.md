# Yogiraj-Pathak-Portfolio

1. Design and Analyze the Layout:- I began by designing the layout and structure of my portfolio. Using Figma, I created wireframes to plan the UI/UX. I focused on making the navigation user-friendly and organized the content in a way that would be easy for users to follow.
2. Develop the Structure with HTML5:- Next, I built the structure of the portfolio using HTML5. I created sections like Home, About, Resume, Projects, and Contact to ensure the content was well-organized and easy to access.
3. Style with CSS3:- After structuring the content, I used CSS3 to style the portfolio. I chose appropriate colors, fonts, and spacing to ensure the design was visually appealing and aligned with a professional aesthetic.
4. Ensure Responsiveness with Bootstrap:- To make the portfolio responsive, I implemented Bootstrap. This allowed the layout to adjust seamlessly across different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth user experience on mobile, tablet, and desktop.
5. Integrate Interactivity with JavaScript:- I added interactive elements using JavaScript. This included dynamic content loading, form validation, and animations to engage users and enhance the overall interactivity of the site.
6. Manage Version Control with GitHub:- I initialized a GitHub repository to track changes and manage the development process. Using GitHub for version control allowed me to efficiently manage updates and collaborate if needed.
7. Deploy the Portfolio:- Once the portfolio was complete, I deployed it using GitHub Pages (or Netlify). This made the portfolio easily accessible online, allowing potential employers and clients to view my work.
